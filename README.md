Karenza The Game
================

**WARNING:** This documentation is provisory and still incomplete. In short I'll be tweaking some rules and completing the examples, and of course, adding some illustrations! Thanks

1. INTRODUCTION
---------------

**1.1 What is Karenza The Game?**

It's an amazing sword fighting strategy card game, where the players represent legendary, epic, surprising and even hilarious warriors of various martial styles that fight each other in thrilling duels to achieve supremacy!

**1.2 Components**

Each player gets a deck of 30 cards, 1 game board and 3 tokens. The cards represent the warrior’s attacking and defending techniques; the board and the tokens represent the warrior’s current pose.

**1.3 Game mechanics**

Karenza is a turn-based game for 2 or more players. In each turn, the players will move the tokens on their boards and play the cards in their hands, always trying to predict the opponent’s intention, build the most sophisticated tactics and combos, to finally attack without the opponent being able to defend, and thus, scoring lots of points!

**1.4 Object**

To score 10 points before the opponent does, or be the one with the highest score when the game ends.


2 THE BOARD AND THE CARDS
-------------------------

2.1 The board

The board represents the warrior’s personal space. It possesses 4 guard squares and a sword space. The guard squares are small circles that represent places where the warrior can put his or her feet. The sword space is an x-shaped canvas that represents the space in which the warrior’s sword will be travelling.

2.2 The tokens
Each player has got 3 tokens: 2 foot tokens and 1 sword token. The foot tokens represent the warrior’s left and right foot, and will always be placed in the board’s guard squares. The sword token represents the warrior’s weapon, and will always be placed in one of the endpoints of the board’s sword space. During the game this tokens will move, always indicating the warrior’s current pose.

2.3 The cards
The cards represent the warriors martial techniques. Each warrior has a distinct set of cards with their own characteristics. A card gives 4 key informations: the type (attack or defense), the power (from 1 to 9), the requisite pose (more on that soon), and the sword trajectory (more on that later). In addition to that, all cards feature a unique name and a wonderful drawing of the warrior performing the technique!
[DRAWING]

2.4 The card’s requisite pose
It’s a small drawing of the board (with the tokens on it) displayed in the low half of the card. It represents the pose in which the warrior must be in order to perform the technique. That means: to be able to play a card, the tokens in the board must be placed like in the card’s requisite pose!
[DRAWING]

2.5 The sword trajectory
On the same drawing containing the requisite pose, there is a trace of the sword trajectory, that indicates the starting point and ending point of the sword.

3 GAMEPLAY

3.1 Game setup
Each player shuffles his or her own deck, offers it to the opponent for him or her to cut, then places it face-down on the table and draws 7 cards. After that, the players decide who will open the game (for example by flipping a coin). The opening player will place the tokens on the board as preferred, and only then the other player will do the same. And the game is set up, the opening player will start!

3.2 The turns
The game is organized in turns. These alternate normally between players (one player plays, then the other, and then the first one again, etc.), except in one occasion described later. Each turn is built of 2 phases which occur always in the following order:  move-tokens phase and play-cards phase.

3.3 Move-tokens phase
In this phase, the player can optionally relocate any token on the board. The only restrictions are: foot tokens always occupy a guard square (only one token per square); and the sword token always occupies a sword space end-point. Be careful! In some cases the number of maximum allowed moves can be less than 3 (read on!). 

3.4 Play-cards phase
In this phase, the player can play 1 card (attack or defense). If you choose so, you must immediately move the sword token as indicated by the card’s sword trajectory. Pay attention now, if you moved the sword token in the move-tokens phase of this turn, you unfortunately can not play a card, sorry! Of course, you can choose not to play any card.

3.5 Having the initiative and being threatened
If your opponent played an attack in his or her last turn, it’s said you’re threatened. This means you must defend yourself from the attack, or else your opponent will score. If your opponent did not play an attack in his or her last turn, it’s said you have the initiative and can attack. If you have the initiative and you do not attack in your turn, it’s said  you pass the initiative to the opponent.

3.6 Attacking
You can attack only when you have the initiative (when you’re not threatened). But you can choose not to attack if you wish so. Remember that the tokens in your board must be in the position indicated in a card’s requisite pose before you play an attack. Now concentrate, this is of extreme importance: If you did move some tokens before playing the attack, count how many moves you did, and tell the opponent when you play the card. When you play an attack you place it on the table face-up, so that the opponent can see it.

3.7 Defending
You can defend only when you are threatened (the opponent played an attack last turn). It is not mandatory, just remember that if you do not play a defense when you’re threatened, the opponent will score! The tokens in your board must also be in the position indicated in a card’s requisite pose before you play a defense. And here comes the key: before playing a defense (in the move-tokens phase), you can move at most as many tokens as your opponent moved to play the attack. If the attack that threatens you was played after moving 2 tokens, then you can move up to 2 tokens (any 2 of them). If the attack was played after moving 1 token, you can move just one (any one). And of course, if the attack was played without any moves, you can only play a defense without moving any token! When you play a defense you place it on the table face-up in front of the corresponding attack.

3.8 Scoring
If one player attacks and the other player does not play a defense (either because he or she can not or does not want to), the attacking player scores as many points as indicated in the power of the attacking card! The player that scored continues to play the next turn, in this manner he or she can connect various attacks and make combos!

3.9 Attack and defense resolution
So what happens when a player attacks, and the other player actually manages to play a defense card? Nobody scores, at least not now! And who will play next turn? It will depend on the power of both cards. If the power of the defense is greater than the power of the attack, the defending player will play next turn. Otherwise (defense power is less or equal than attack power), the attacking player will play next turn. Easy, ain’t it?

3.10 Discarding
In your turn, if you have the initiative (see definition above), and you choose not to play a card (or can not play it), you still can optionally discard a card. To discard a card, just pick a card from your hand and put it aside face-up. This action can help you get rid of cards you won’t use. You can use a single pile for all the cards that are put aside in the game, always face-up.

3.11 Passing the initiative and drawing event
Every time a player passes the initiative, some things take place: First, all the cards that are on the table are removed and put on the discard pile of the corresponding player. In addition to that, a drawing event takes place. In a drawing event, both players (yes, both!) will draw from their respective decks as many cards as necessary to complete 7 cards in hand. For example: if a player has 2 cards in hand when a drawing event takes place, he (or she) will draw 5 cards (2 + 5 = 7). If a player has 6 cards in hand, he (or she) will draw just 1 card. If a player already has 7 cards in hand, then he or she won’t draw any cards.

3.12 The game ends
The game ends when a player (the winner) scores 10 or more points. It also immediately ends if, in a drawing event, a player should draw a card and can not (because his or her deck is empty). In this case, the player with the highest score wins!

4 EXAMPLE GAME

4.1 Introduction
Let’s consider a game between two imaginary players, say Joey and Rachel. We’ll follow it turn by turn so that you can understand how it goes. For simplicity reasons they will play with only 3 cards in hand. When you play in the real world, remember to use 7 cards!

4.2 Setup
Joey and Rachel shuffle their respective decks and hand them face-down to the other. Now Joey cuts Rachel’s deck and Rachel does the same with Joey’s deck and both hand the decks back to their owners. After that, Joey and Rachel decide who will start the game by flipping a coin (Joey wins, so he will start). Now both players draw 3 cards. Here’s Joey’s hand, he plays with Masaru, the great samurai:
[DRAWING]
And here’s Rachel’s hand, she plays with Lanying, the beautiful chinese swordswoman:
[DRAWING]
And as Joey will start the game, he is the first to place the tokens in his board, he places them like this: 
[DRAWING]
Then, it’s Rachel’s turn to place the tokens in her board, she places them like that:
[DRAWING]
Note that Joey and Rachel analyzed their cards to decide where to place the tokens on their boards.
And the game is set up! Ready... Fight!

4.3 Gameplay

 1st turn (Joey)
As this is the first turn of the game, Joey has the initiative. He will risk and try to launch a quick attack, he moves the left foot token to (A) and plays the following card:
[DRAWING]
He had to move 1 token (left foot), so that the 3 tokens were placed as indicated in the attack’s requisite pose. And after playing the card, he moves also the sword token as indicated in the card’s sword trajectory.

2nd turn (Rachel)
Rachel is threatened, because last turn Joey played an attack card. And she remembers Joey played the attack by just moving 1 token. So Rachel can only play a defense card moving 1 token at most. Luckily, she has one card she can play. She moves the sword token to (2) and plays the following defense:
[DRAWING]
She also moves the sword token as indicated in the card’s sword trajectory. The power of her defense (4) is, however, lower than Joey’s attack (6), so she does not win the initiative, and the next turn is going to be played regularly by Joey.

3rd turn (Joey)
Joey has the initiative again. His last attack did not score, but he will try it again. He moves 2 tokens this time: the right foot to (C ) and the sword to (4); and then plays the following attack:
[DRAWING]

4th turn (Rachel)
Well, Rachel is threatened again. But this time, she feels more confident. She will play a defense without needing to move any token in her board:
[DRAWING]
The power of her defense is now greater than the power of Joey’s attack, she wins the initiative, and she will play next turn!

5th turn (Rachel again)
Now Rachel has the initiative! But she does not see any opportunity of attack in her hand. So, instead of playing a card, she’ll try a new strategy. She will move 2 tokens and leave her fighter prepared to play the defense card she has in hand:
[DRAWING]
After that she passes the initiative to Joey, thus, triggering a draw event.

Initiative passed and draw event
As the initiative has been passed, both players remove the 2 cards they’ve played and put them on their respective discard piles face-up. Then, the drawing event takes place and both players draw as many cards as necessary to have 3 cards in their hands. Rachel and Joey both have 1 card in hand, so they will draw 2 cards each.

6th turn (Joey)
So Joey has the initiative again! And his hand looks like this now:
[DRAWING]
This time, he will be more cautious: he will build an attacking strategy. He places his tokens….. 




5 TIPS AND TRICKS

This means that the players can somehow anticipate the opponent’s intentions, based on the position of the tokens on his or her board! And also, a player can try to hide his or her plans or try to trick the opponent by strategically moving the tokens on the board.
